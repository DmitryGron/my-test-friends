# A test project for intellyo.
Made based the essential-react library.


# Changelog and how I worked

First I went to c9.io to create a node server for the rest endpoint.
I created a node.js workspace there and I used the json-server library for creating the mock json.
Copy-pasting the json from the project the
https://list-the-guys-gazdagergo.c9users.io/reactUsers
started working.
(18 minutes)

To find a good starter with pre-configured webpack and test libraries I visited the
https://www.andrewhfarmer.com/starter-project/
filterted on router and test and excluded redux
It seemed that https://github.com/pheuter/essential-react will be a good choice, so I forked it.

I set up a firebase hosting and continouos integratin with travis ci, so my app is available via web and re-deployed automatically on push here:
https://my-test-friends.firebaseapp.com

I also set up the real time database with the user on firebase so it is now available via rest here:
https://my-test-friends.firebaseio.com/users.json
So the c9 should not be used anymore, all is in one place.

## Design Goals

- Use fewer tools (no yeoman, gulp, bower, etc...)
- Babel 6 with Webpack and Hot Loader
- Fast testing with mocked-out DOM
- Import css files as class names
- Separate [Smart and Dumb](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) components
- No specific implementation of Flux or data fetching patterns


## Getting Started

```sh
$ npm install
```

Start the local dev server:

```sh
$ npm run server
```

Navigate to **http://localhost:8080/** to view the app.

## Commands

A core philosophy of this skeleton app is to keep the tooling to a minimum. For this reason, you can find all the commands in the `scripts` section of [package.json](package.json).

### server

```sh
$ npm run server
```

**Input:** `src/main.jsx`

This leverages [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) to automatically start a local dev server and refresh file changes on the fly without reloading the page.

It also automatically includes source maps, allowing you to browse code and set breakpoints on the original ES6 code:

### build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

**Input:** `src/main.jsx`

**Output:** `build/app.js`

Build minified app for production using the [production](http://webpack.github.io/docs/cli.html#production-shortcut-p) shortcut.

### test

```sh
$ npm test
```

**Input:** `test/main.js`

**Output:** `coverage/`

Leverages [ava](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava) to execute the test suite and generate code coverage reports using [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc)

### coveralls

```sh
$ npm run coveralls
```

**Input:** `coverage/lcov.info`

Sends the code coverage report generated by [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc) to [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io/).

### clean

```sh
$ npm run clean
```

**Input:** `build/app.js`

Removes the compiled app file from build.
